## Supervised learning

Supervised learning refers to the fact that we gave the algorithm a data set in which the "right answers" were given.

## Regression

To predict a continuous value output.

For example:We can use the data set to predict the house price.

The prices are discrete values,but the quantities are too many,we can think of the price as a continuous value number.The term regression refers to the fact that we're trying to predict the sort of continuous values attribute.


## Classification

The term classification refers to the fact that we're trying to predict a discrete value output: zero or one(Yes or No quesetion).

But in classification problems sometimes you can have more than two values for the two possible values for the output.

## Other

### The main difference between Regression and classification

The main difference between Regression and classification is the goal to predict a continuous valued output or a discrete value output.

### We want to use an infinite number of features,but our memory is limited.How can we solve this problem?

There is an algorithm called the Support Vector Machine,which will be a neat mathematical trick that will allow a computer to deal with an infinite number of features.
