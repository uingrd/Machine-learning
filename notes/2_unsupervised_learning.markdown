## Unsupervised learning

Compare to Supervised learning,the data looks different because it doesn't have any labels or that all has the same label or really no labels.

We're given the data set and we're not told what to do with it and we're not told what each data point is.We only know that here is a data set.

We can derive this structure by clustering the data based on relationships among the variables in the data.

Unsupervised learning allows us to approach problems with little or no idea what our results should look like. We can derive structure from data where we don't necessarily know the effect of the variables.

## Clustering algorithm

An Unsupervised Learning algorithm might decide that the data lives in different clusters.


## Octave

A free open source software help us learn the machine learning algorithms quickly.

## Be careful

With unsupervised learning there is no feedback based on the prediction results.
